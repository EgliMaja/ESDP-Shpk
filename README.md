- An input file which loads, reads and parses the file inside test1M.zip
    and display the elements in the DOM according to the format displayed in the video.

- The height of each element of the list should be 30px.

- A search box for filtering elements according to:
    Name, surname, street, city.

- At the beginning of the element, the number of its render in the list should also appear.

- A message when no data was found.

- During the loading of the file, find a loader as desired (https://loading.io/css/).

* The scrolling in the list should be fast and there should be no lag regardless of the device parameters.
